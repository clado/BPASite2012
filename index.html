<p id = "text">Indianapolis has lots of potential as the 2014 BPA National site. Beautiful buildings dominate this city, with skyscrapers and many kinds of commercial and industrial practices. Cement-bordered canals give the city a fresh, more natural look, though the main attraction of Indianapolis, as with most cities, is the architecture.

Beautiful churches dot the city, adding their own flavor with their Gothic structures. Pointed arches, spires, and stained glass windows dot the structures. Museums are also a great place to visit; they’re great attractions for children (who have their own museum!) and adults alike. Science museums, history museums, and even racecar museums occupy the city, and they bring attractive days of fun.

One of the city’s few parks, Eagle Creek, gives access to a beautiful flowing river and beaches for playing in the sand, when it’s not too cold. This, along with playgrounds and activities, make the city a good place for children.

Nationals would, ideally, be held somewhere near several hotels, so transportation between the site and living quarters would be easier. Events would be mapped, and contestants could arrive early for activities. Hopefully, somewhere there would be a pool, because swimming is amazing. After all the events, dinner could be served, and the BPA members could hear any speeches that the hosts would want to say and could discuss the events of the day.

Ladies and gentlemen, Indianapolis, Indiana.
