<h1>Museums</h1>
<p>Indianapolis harbors a wealth of museums fit for all interests, with a perfect choice for every chapter. From the superficial delights of the children</p>

<h3>The Indianapolis Children&#39;s Museum</h3>
<p>Although it may sound like an attraction a five year old would rather go to, the children&#39;s museum of Indianapolis holds just as much in store for teenagers as their younger counterparts. Decorated with a beautiful dinosaur peeking in through the outside of the building, it&#39;s impossible not to be enticed by this charming museum. With new exhibits rotating monthly, some of the exhibits you can always count on include: the Dinosphere (complete with life-size, moving dinosaurs), a stunning planetarium show, a 43-foot-tall glass sculpture by artist Dale Chihuly, and a beautifully restored carousel dating back to 1917. Without a doubt, this children&#39;s museum is perfectly equipped to help children and adults alike uncover their inner whimsy.</p>

<object width="420" height="236"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mU-wSmP0nYU?hl=en_US&amp;version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mU-wSmP0nYU?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="236" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>The children&#39;s museum is located on 3000 N. Meridian St, just down the street from the Indianapolis fairgrounds, and is open from 10 to 5 daily from March to Labour Day. In order to get the most out of your visit, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.childrensmuseum.org/">their site</a> to get tickets to any limited time exhibits. Admission can also be somewhat expensive, at $13.50 per student, but groups who register 2-weeks in advance can receive a 20% discount.</p>

<h3>Indianapolis Museum of Art</h3>
<p>All art institutes are interesting in their own way, but the Indianapolis Museum of Art surges about competition with over 54,000 works of art, not including traveling exhibitions. Permanent works include Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, the famous "Fine Wind, Clear Morning" by Katsushika Hokusai, and a great many artists that have fallen into obscurity over time. This museum also sets itself apart from the rest with 152 acres of outdoor parks, with make for a perfectly engaging and amazing out-of-doors experience in the scenic city of Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Museum of Art is located at 4000 Michigan Road, but before you go, be sure to check your planned time with <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/visit">their hours</a>, which vary with the days of the week. Admission to this museum and its surrounding parks is absolutely free, with the exception of some special exhibits. Tours for groups are also available, and details can be found <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/programs/schools-and-community/pre-k-12">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians &amp; Western Art</h3>
<p>From a green perch over-looking the Central Canal, the Eiteljorg Museum features post-modern architecture reminiscent of the adobe houses of the Hohokam-Anasazi, its unique blend of American and indigenous cultures indicative of its insides. Founded by Harrison Eiteljorg, this museum aims to increase awareness and interest in civilizations native to North America and also highlights experiences of the American west. From pistols and motorcycles to minorities in the west, this museum has something to offer every chapter while maintaining an intriguing Native American focus. Artists featured at this museum include Georgia O'Keeffe, Allan Houser, Frederic Remington, Charles Russel, T.C. Cannon, Kay WalkingStick, N.C. Wyeth, and Andy Warhol. The latter is, admittedly, not Native American, but this can only speak to this collection as one with the capacity to interest any type of student.</p>

<p>To learn more about the exciting offerings of this museum, their site can be found <a href="http://www.eiteljorg.org/">here</a>. Located at 500 West Washington St, the Eiteljorg Museum is open from 10-5 Mondays through Saturdays, and from noon to 5 on Sundays. Although this museum offers no special pricing for groups, it is one of the cheaper museums at $6 per youth, and $2 discounts are available for groups rooming at local hotels.</p>

<h3>Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library</h3>
<p>A library may sound like the worst possible place to take a field trip, but this library is one of the most interesting museums in Indiana. Kurt Vonnegut, Indianapolis native, was drafted into the army at 20 years old and sent to fight in World War II, captured during the Battle of the Bulge in an experience that would fuel his most celebrated work: <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>. Complete with his original type writer, purple heart, and a Nazi sword, this museum is sure to interest even those who have yet to hear of the amazingness that is Kurt Vonnegut. As a smaller museum, this attraction is more suited to smaller chapters and makes for a quick stop. However as Military Park and the previously mentioned Eiteljorg Museum are close by, this tiny spot of wonder can offer an unforgettable experience for those who take the time to stop in on their way to the park.</p>
<p>Be careful when scheduling trips to this museum, as it is not open on Wednesdays. (It's open 12-5 all other days.) Entry is free, however tips are appreciated. If you would like more information about the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library, feel free to stop by their <a href="http://www.vonnegutlibrary.org/">website</a>, or stop in and see them at 340 N. Senate Ave, Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>

<h3>Indiana Transportation Museum</h3>
<p>As an outdoor museum complete with a restored and functional railway, this museum exists in a category all its own. <img src="mikado.jpg" class="imgright" alt="1918 USRA Light Mikado" width="128" height="192"> Over 100 artifacts are available for viewing in an setting perfect for enjoying the lovely spring weather. There exists also a chance to see trains dating from as far back as 1898, such as a 1918 USRA Light Mikado, pictured at right. Before or after a trip to the museum lies a ride on the railway in an authentic train, making this museum truly unique and a must-have experience for all chapters.</p>
<p>The actual location of this museum is difficult to pin down, as there are boarding sites staggered throughout the railway, which begins at the state fair and travels north to Tipton. (A full map is available <a href="http://www.itm.org/about_locations.html">here</a>.) The museum itself is located at its Noblesville location, from where chartered trips begin. Because it is staffed almost entirely by volunteers, the museum and railway are only open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays. Charters are available for groups to come during the weekdays, costing anywhere from $5 to $70 per person, just be sure to schedule in advance by calling (317)-773-6000.</p>

<h3>Indiana Medical History Museum</h3>
<p>Over 15,000 artifacts from turn of the century medicine, state of the art over 100 years ago, are now on display at this one of a kind museum in Indianapolis. Formed from the old Pathological Department of the Central State Hospital, the Indiana Medical History Museum offers authentic medical facilities for viewing and, if that wasn't enough, a garden populated with healing plants. Not just for med school hopefuls, these ancient medicinal practices are sure to excite, frighten, and amaze just about everyone with just how far modern medicine has advanced these last hundred years.</p>
<p>Going to this museum takes a bit of advance planning, but it is most definitely worth it. The museum may only be explored by tour, and groups of 10 or more people must schedule at least 3 weeks in advance. Admissions run at $3 per student, and more information can be found <a href="http://www.imhm.org/">here</a>. This museum is located at 3045 Vermont Street and is only open Wednesdays through Saturdays.</p>
